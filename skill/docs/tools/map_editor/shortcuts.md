### Locked Selection

- **Cltr+L** – Lock Vertex/Node Selection
- **Ctrl+Alt+L** – Reset Vertex/Node Lock

### Move Mode

LMB dragging with a node moves with the selected items. Whole multiselection is moved when dragged with one node (must be from the multiselection).

- **Tab** – Changes gizmo orientation.
- **Shift+Tab** – Changes gizmo orientation (backward direction).
- **X** – During move locks to X axis.
- **Y** – During move locks to Y axis.
- **Z** – During move locks to Z axis.
- **Shift+X** – During move locks to YZ plane.
- **Shift+Y** – During move locks to XZ plane.
- **Shift+Z** – During move locks to XY plane.
- **Shift+LMB** – During move disconnects the dragged node from the chain. Useful for roads, buildings and prefabs.
- **Alt** – During move snaps also Y axis (height). The standard snap leaves Y be.
- **Ctrl+Shift** – Before pressing LMB duplicates and moves current selection.
- **X** – Toggle between circle/curve mode.

If you are locked to single axis, you can use numpad to control movement or rotation.

- **Numpad number keys** - Enter value.
- **Numpad plus/minus** - Make value positive/negative.
- **Backspace** - Delete last digit.
- **Delete** - Throw away the value and get back to control move or rotation with mouse.

Vertex move:

### Rotation Mode

LMB dragging rotates the selected node in the selected axis. This does not work for multiselection.

#### Single selection

- **R** – Cycles between the axes X, Y, Z and LMB dragging with.

#### Multiselection

- **R** – Rotates the selected items clockwise by 90 degrees around their center in Y axis. With Shift it rotates only by 1 degree. With Ctrl it rotates counter-clockwise.

#### Free Node Rotation

Works for buildings, walkers and roads. In their node properties there is Free Rotation checkbox. With this turned on the node direction is not updated during internal computations but stays as it was set up by user. It could be useful when you want to set a specific rotation for road or building nodes to tweak the geometry shape.

### Brush Mode

- **Ctrl+LMB** – Removes a stamp.
- **Shift+LMB** – Picks a stamp settings (shows it in the stamp dialog).

### Place Start Mode

- **LMB** – Put placement of the start truck position on the world map.
- **Num+/-** – Rotate start placement orientation.

### Terrain Picker Mode

This mode allows picking "terrain patterns" from roads, terrains and prefabs and reapplying them to other items (it is similar to Format Painter known in office software). The tool does live preview of terrain properties change when hovering over an item.
