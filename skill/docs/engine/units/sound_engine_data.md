# Documentation/Engine/Units/sound engine data

The **sound_engine_data** unit class is used to define engine sounds. This unit is typically used in an array, with _min_rpm_ and _max_rpm_ ranges overlapping between members to allow crossfading.

## Uses

- [accessory_sound_data](/wiki/Documentation/Engine/Units/accessory_sound_data "Documentation/Engine/Units/accessory sound data") (engine, engine_load, engine_nofuel, engine_exhaust, engine_brake)
